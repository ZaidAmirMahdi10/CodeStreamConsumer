# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Backend Application**: An Express.js app.
2. **Frontend Application**: A React.js app.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run both the backend and frontend applications.

---

## Backend Application

The backend is built using Express.js. It handles server-side logic and API endpoints.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- Install dependencies using:

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

### Starting the Backend

To start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:3007` (or the port specified in your configuration).

---

## Frontend Application

The frontend is built using React.js. It provides the user interface for interacting with the application.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed on your machine.
- Install dependencies using:

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

### Starting the Frontend

To start the frontend development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port if the backend is already using `3000`).

---

## Notes

- Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend if the frontend relies on API endpoints.
- Customize environment variables (e.g., `PORT`) as needed for your setup.
